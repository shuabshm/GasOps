10.1 Pipe transportation, handling and storage shall be in accordance with Company Specification G-8003, "Transporting, Handling, and Storing Steel Gas Pipe".
10.2 The vendor shall be responsible for damages to the pipe or coating due to transportation.
11.0 INSPECTION AND REJECTION OF PIPE
11.1 Bare pipe shall be visually inspected for dents, gouges, grooves, or arc burns prior to surface preparation by the Coater. Any defects found shall be reported to the Transportation and Stores Department of the Company and the damaged pipe length in question shall not be coated.
11.2 A dent that contains or affects the longitudinal weld is not acceptable.
11.3 Pipe containing a dent in which the dent contains a scratch, gouge, groove or arc burn is not acceptable. A dent may be defined as a depression, which produces a gross disturbance in the curvature of the pipe wall as opposed to a scratch or gouge that reduces the pipe wall thickness.
11.4 The pipe shall contain no dents greater than 1/4 inch. The length of the dent in any direction shall not exceed one-half the pipe diameter.
11.5 Pipe containing gouges or grooves having a depth greater than 12 percent of the specified wall thickness, measured from the surface of the pipe is not acceptable.
11.6 Pipe containing any arc burns is not acceptable.
11.7 The Company reserves the right to inspect, test and subsequently reject any pipe that does not conform in any way to the standards set forth in this specification, or the API or ASTM Specification under which the pipe is manufactured, or the associated coating specifications as set forth herein. The vendor shall be liable for all costs incurred by the Company as a result of pipe failing to comply with this specification.

13.0 QUALITY CONTROL
13.1 The vendor shall submit written notification to the Chief Gas Engineer, Gas Transmission Engineering or duly authorized representative of any changes to be made by the manufacturer concerning the design, fabrication, material or marking of the pipe. This notification shall be made in advance of any changes and must receive written approval from the Chief Gas Engineer, Gas Transmission Engineering or duly authorized representative in order to be acceptable.
13.2 The vendor shall keep records of all materials supplied to Con Edison. The records shall include mill certificates, the material description, the manufacturer and the heat numbers. They shall be available to Con Edison upon request.
13.3 The vendor shall maintain a quality control program to insure that all pipe shipped to Con Edison meets referenced standards.
13.4 For pipe that is 8" and larger, dimensional data shall be recorded for a minimum of 10% of each item in each shipment. Dimensional data shall include outside diameter, wall thickness, roundness, bevel ends, etc. The vendor shall externally mark each inspected length of pipe with a painted yellow dot readily visible to Con Edison inspectors. The vendor shall maintain these records at their facility and make them available to Con Edison upon request.
13.5 When an out-of-specification length of pipe is found by the vendor in a shipment, the entire shipment shall be inspected and documented before shipment to Con Edison. The vendor shall maintain these records at their facility and make them available to Con Edison upon request.
13.6 Any pipe to be used for transmission (>125psig) shall be toughness tested as per "Appendix A - Steel Pipe Toughness Standards For All New Pipe >125 Psig". This will be requested when required. These test results will be sent to Gas Transmission Engineering - Major Projects for approval prior to delivery to the pipe coater and Con Edison. One set of toughness tests is required for every 100 lengths per heat of pipe.

APPENDIX A
STEEL PIPE TOUGHNESS STANDARDS FOR ALL NEW PIPE > 125 PSIG
PIPE SAMPLES:
1" through 10", cut 6" long pipe section 12" through 36", cut 8" x 8" coupons Note: the test coupon must include the seam area on all welded pipe.
PIPE IDENTIFICATION:
Samples shall be from the same lot number or heat number.
CHARPY V-NOTCH (CVN) TOUGHNESS TESTS:
Full size samples shall be tested at a temperature of -10 degrees F and as per API 5L SR5A/SR5B, ASTM E23 and ASTM A370. Three CVN specimens shall be evaluated for each test: the Base Metal, the Weld, and the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). Acceptable values for each test are as follows:
ABSORBED ENERGY:
MINIMUM OF EACH TEST SPECIMEN ≥ 15 FT-LB
LATERAL EXPANSION:
MINIMUM OF EACH TEST SPECIMEN ≥ 0.020 IN.
PERCENT SHEAR:
MINIMUM OF EACH TEST SPECIMEN ≥ 20 %
Note: If subsize samples are used, the test temperature shall be lowered and absorbed energy adjusted to be equivalent to full size samples at -10 degrees F as per ASTM A370 and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Div. 1, Subsection A, UG-84 requirements. Also for this condition (sub size samples) percent shear is not required.
