7.4 Re-establishment of a Welding Procedure
A welding procedure must be re-established as a new procedure when any of the essential variables listed in API 1104 are changed.
* 8.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR WELDERS
*
8.1 One unannounced non-destructive test (Spot Check) must be made at least once each calendar year at intervals not exceeding 15 months, on at least one of each welder's welds. A field weld is defined as any production weld. Non-destructive testing can include radiography, mag- particle or dye penetrant examinations performed by an independent testing agency. The installing organization shall maintain all inspection records in an electronic database where the inspection reports are scanned into. Engineering shall be notified of all completed spot checks.
If a welder on the list did not have a spot check performed, arrangements should be made to have a spot check completed. It shall be the responsibility of each organization, who has qualified welders, to arrange for the spot checks of their welders. For example, it shall be the responsibility of Construction Services to spot check their welders and contractor welders assigned to Construction Services.
Failure of a spot check requires unannounced testing of an additional weld. A second failure requires another unannounced test of an additional weld. A third failure requires the welder to take the initial qualification test again. All follow-up unannounced spot checks of a welder must be conducted within three months or as soon as possible.
By the end of the 15th month, if a welder has not had a spot check performed, their welding qualification will be suspended. The welder can have their qualification reinstated, if their first weld on their next job is non-destructively tested and is acceptable.
A welder's certification card shall be inspected and compared to the "Qualified Welders" list for compliance by a Gas Engineering approved 3rd party weld testing agency and/or a Con Edison Field Representative.
