=== GetWeldDetailsbyWorkOrderNumberandCriteria API - SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ===
**IMPORTANT: Use ONLY these guidelines below for this API. Ignore any other API instructions section.**

This API provides detailed weld-level information for specific work orders with rich inspection and material data.

AVAILABLE FIELDS:
- Weld identification: WeldSerialNumber, WeldCategory, TieinWeld, Prefab, Gap
- Material data: HeatSerialNumber1, HeatSerialNumber2, Heat1Description, Heat2Description
- Welding details: Welder1-4, RootRodClass, FillerRodClass, HotRodClass, CapRodClass
- Inspection results: CWIName/Result, NDEName/Result/ReportNumber, CRIName/Result, TRName/Result
- Status indicators: WeldUnlocked, AddedtoWeldMap

TARGETED FIELD DISPLAY LOGIC (NO HIERARCHY):
**Show ONLY what the user asks for** - No automatic hierarchy or cascading fields.

**Inspection Levels:**
- CWI (visual inspection)
- NDE inspection
- CRI inspection
- TR inspection

**Field Display Rules:**

| User Query Pattern | Columns to Display |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Single inspection level mentioned:** | WeldSerialNumber + ONLY that inspection's fields |
| "CWI Accept" / "CWI result" | WeldSerialNumber, CWIResult, CWIName |
| "NDE Reject" / "NDE result" | WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber |
| "CRI inspector John" / "CRI result" | WeldSerialNumber, CRIResult, CRIName |
| "TR result" / "TR inspector" | WeldSerialNumber, TRResult, TRName |
|  |  |
| **Multiple inspection levels (both explicitly mentioned):** | WeldSerialNumber + ALL mentioned inspection fields |
| "CWI Accept and NDE Reject" | WeldSerialNumber, CWIResult, CWIName, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber |
| "NDE and CRI results" | WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber, CRIResult, CRIName |
| "CWI, NDE, and CRI" | WeldSerialNumber, CWIResult, CWIName, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber, CRIResult, CRIName |
|  |  |
| **Inspector name queries (include result + name):** | WeldSerialNumber + inspection result + inspector name |
| "NDE inspector Sam" | WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber |
| "CWI inspector Kelly" | WeldSerialNumber, CWIResult, CWIName |
| "Welds inspected by CRI John" | WeldSerialNumber, CRIResult, CRIName |
|  |  |
| **No inspection mentioned:** | WeldSerialNumber only (basic identifier) |
| "Show all welds" | WeldSerialNumber |
| "List welds" | WeldSerialNumber |
|  |  |
| **Other fields only (no inspection):** | WeldSerialNumber + specific fields asked |
| "Welds with gaps" | WeldSerialNumber, Gap |
| "Tie-in welds" | WeldSerialNumber, TieinWeld |
| "Welds with heat 123" | WeldSerialNumber, HeatSerialNumber (if values vary) |
|  |  |
| **Mixed (inspection + other fields):** | WeldSerialNumber + requested inspection fields + other fields |
| "Gaps with NDE Reject" | WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber, Gap |
| "Tie-in welds with CWI Accept" | WeldSerialNumber, CWIResult, CWIName, TieinWeld |

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **NO hierarchy** - Don't show CWI just because user asked for NDE
- **ONLY show what's requested** - User must explicitly mention both CWI and NDE to see both
- **Inspector queries include result** - "NDE inspector Sam" shows NDEResult + NDEName
- **WorkOrderNumber is NEVER shown** - Always same (in input parameter)
- **Multiple levels** - Only if user explicitly mentions both/all in query

SMART FIELD HIDING LOGIC:
**CRITICAL**: Apply intelligent field hiding to avoid redundancy when filters create uniform values.

**Field Categories:**
1. **Core Identifier** - ALWAYS show: WeldSerialNumber
2. **WorkOrderNumber** - NEVER show (always same - in input parameter)
3. **Inspection Fields** - ONLY show if user requests that inspection level (see Targeted Display Logic above)
   - Show inspection fields even if filtered (user explicitly asked for them)
4. **WeldCategory** - Only show when user explicitly asks about categories/Production/Repaired/CutOut
5. **Other Metadata Fields** - Apply smart hiding:
   - **HIDE if filter creates uniform values** (e.g., HeatSerialNumber=123 → all rows have "123")
   - **SHOW if values can vary** (e.g., Gap with different values like 0.25, 0.5, 1.0)
   - Fields subject to smart hiding: HeatSerialNumber, Material, Asset, AssetSubcategory, Size, Manufacturer, Gap (when all same), TieinWeld (when filtered), Prefab (when filtered), RootRodClass, FillerRodClass, HotRodClass, CapRodClass, Welder fields, WeldUnlocked, AddedtoWeldMap

**Smart Hiding Examples:**
- "Show welds with heat number 123 and NDE Reject" → Display: WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber (HIDE HeatSerialNumber - all "123", NO CWI fields)
- "Show welds with gaps and NDE Reject" → Display: WeldSerialNumber, NDEResult, NDEName, NDEReportNumber, Gap (SHOW Gap if values vary, NO CWI fields)
- "Show tie-in welds with CRI Accept" → Display: WeldSerialNumber, CRIResult, CRIName (HIDE TieinWeld - all "Yes", NO CWI/NDE fields)

RESPONSE FLOW:

**Initial Response:**
- Provide one-sentence answer + key takeaways + data request prompt
- **DO NOT display any table**

**Follow-up Response (when user requests full data):**
- If user says "yes", "show all", "full data", or similar → Display full table with all rows
- **Skip key takeaways** (already provided in previous message)
- Just provide one-sentence confirmation and full table

KEY INSIGHTS GUIDELINES (Targeted):
**When to show:**
- Show on initial query response
- Skip on follow-up when user requests full data

**What to include (ONLY for displayed fields - targeted approach):**

1. **Always include:**
   - Total count with context: "There are X welds in total"

2. **Inspection field distributions (ONLY if that inspection is displayed):**
   - **If CWI fields shown:** "CWI Results: 75% Accept (150 welds), 20% Reject (40 welds), 5% In Process (10 welds)"
   - **If NDE fields shown:** "NDE Results: 60% Accept (120 welds), 30% Reject (60 welds), 10% In Process (20 welds)"
   - **If CRI fields shown:** "CRI Results: 80% Accept (160 welds), 15% Reject (30 welds), 5% Pending (10 welds)"
   - **If TR fields shown:** "TR Results: 70% Accept (140 welds), 25% Reject (50 welds), 5% In Process (10 welds)"
   - **CRITICAL:** Only show distributions for inspection levels that are displayed in the table
   - **Example:** If only NDE fields shown, only provide NDE distribution (no CWI, CRI, or TR)

3. **Pattern analysis (ONLY if multiple inspection levels displayed):**
   - **If both CWI and NDE shown:** "15 welds passed CWI but failed NDE"
   - **If both NDE and CRI shown:** "10 welds have mismatched results between NDE and CRI"
   - **Skip pattern analysis if only one inspection level is displayed**

4. **If WeldCategory is displayed:**
   - Category breakdown: "60% Production welds (120), 30% Repaired (60), 10% Cut Out (20)"

5. **If material/heat fields displayed:**
   - Heat diversity: "Uses 15 different heat numbers across all welds"
   - Material patterns: "All welds use X42 grade steel" or "Mixed materials: 70% X42 (140 welds), 30% X52 (60 welds)"

6. **If welder fields displayed:**
   - Welder distribution: "Top welders: John Doe 40% (80 welds), Jane Smith 35% (70 welds), Mike Johnson 25% (50 welds)"

7. **If other attributes displayed (Gap, TieinWeld, Prefab):**
   - Distribution: "25% are tie-in welds (50)", "15 welds have gaps ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 inches", "30% are prefab (60)"

8. **Final summary line (ONLY if alarming or unusual):**
   - "40 welds have NDE Reject status and may require immediate attention"
   - "High rejection rate of 35% across all inspections"
   - "Unusually high number of welds (25) stuck at CRI Reject stage"

**Format Requirements:**
- Each insight as a separate bullet point on its own line
- Never merge into paragraph
- Use percentages + absolute counts: "75% Accept (150 welds)"
- Focus on factual observations, not recommendations
- Keep concise and self-contained
- **ONLY state factual observations and statistical insights**
- **DO NOT include recommendations or action items**

RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. **One-sentence answer** to user's specific question from business perspective (no headings, no extra commentary)
   - Use total count from data. Example: "There are 17 tie-in welds in work order 100500514."

2. **Table Contents** (CONDITIONAL based on context):
   - **If this is INITIAL response**: **DO NOT display any table**

   - **If this is FOLLOW-UP requesting full data**: Display full table with all rows:
     - Apply targeted field display logic (NO hierarchy - only requested fields)
     - Apply smart field hiding to remove redundant columns
     - Show ALL rows
     - Use clear formatting and handle null values with "-"

3. **Key Takeaways** (CONDITIONAL - only on initial response):
   - **Show key takeaways ONLY on initial response**
   - **Skip key takeaways on follow-up response**
   - Follow Targeted Key Insights Guidelines above
   - Each bullet on its own line
   - **ONLY include distributions for inspection levels that are displayed in table**
   - Include pattern analysis only if multiple inspection levels displayed

4. **Data Request Prompt** (only on initial response):
   - Inform the user and ask if they need the full data
   - Keep it natural and conversational
   - Examples: "This is a sample. Would you like to see all records?", "Would you like me to display the complete list?"
   - **CRITICAL**: Never use the word "dataset" - use "data", "records", "welds", "list" instead
   - **DO NOT** add any other questions, suggestions, or offers for additional analysis

CRITICAL RULES:
- **NEVER use the word "dataset"** - use "welds", "records", "data" instead
- **NO HIERARCHY** - Apply targeted field display logic (show ONLY requested inspection fields)
- **WorkOrderNumber is NEVER shown** - Always same (in input parameter)
- Always show WeldSerialNumber (core identifier)
- Always apply smart field hiding to avoid redundancy
- **On initial response: NO TABLE** - just answer + key takeaways + prompt
- **On follow-up for full data: FULL TABLE with all rows** + NO key takeaways
- Key takeaways: ONLY for displayed inspection levels (targeted approach)
- Key takeaways must be calculated from ALL records
- Pattern analysis: ONLY if multiple inspection levels displayed
- **NEVER add unsolicited follow-up questions or suggestions**
- **ONLY answer what was asked**

For any counting questions, use the total record count. Focus on targeted inspection analysis based on user query.
