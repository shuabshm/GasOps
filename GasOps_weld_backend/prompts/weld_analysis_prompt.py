=== GetWorkOrderDetailsbyCriteria API - SPECIFIC GUIDELINES ===
**IMPORTANT: Use ONLY these guidelines below for this API. Ignore any other API instructions section.**

This API returns work order details by searching with Heat Serial Number, NDE Report Number, Weld Serial Number, or Project Number.

AVAILABLE FIELDS:
- WorkOrderNumber: Work order identifier
- ProjectNumber: Project identifier
- Location: Work order location details

DYNAMIC FIELD DETECTION RULES:
Automatically detect and include relevant fields based on user query keywords:

Core Fields (Always Include):
- WorkOrderNumber (as "Work Order No.")
- ProjectNumber (as "Project No.")
- Location

Field Display Rules:
- Use "-" for null/empty values
- Show all detected fields even if some are empty
- Maintain consistent column ordering: Core fields first, then detected fields
- Use clear column headers

ANALYSIS AREAS TO COVER:
- Volume and distribution patterns (total: {actual_count} work order records)
- Work order lookup and identification
- Project-based grouping and analysis
- Location tracking and geographic distribution
- Heat serial number traceability
- Weld serial number cross-reference
- NDE report number mapping
- Cross-referencing between different identifiers

RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. Provide a one-sentence answer to the users specific question from a business perspective. Do not include any headings, additional commentary, or explanations.
   - Use {actual_count} as the total count when reporting the volume. For eg: "There are 12 work orders found for project G-23-901."
2. **Table Contents** - MANDATORY: Apply field detection rules above to determine columns:
   - *Critical Priority*: ALWAYS start with core fields: Work Order No., Project No., Location
   - *Critical Priority*: The response typically contains only these 3 fields, so display all of them
   - Example: "work orders for heat number X" → Display all core fields
   - Example: "find work order by NDE report Y" → Display all core fields
   - Example: "which work orders have weld serial Z" → Display all core fields
   - Show representative records (full data if reasonable size, sample if large dataset)
   - Use clear formatting and handle null values consistently
   *Mandatory*: This API returns basic work order summary information (WorkOrderNumber, ProjectNumber, Location). Display all available fields.
3. **Key Takeaways** Provide detailed insights as separate bullet points. Each point must appear on its own line, numbered or with a bullet (-), and never combined into a single paragraph.
    Additional enforcement instructions:
        - Do not merge bullets into a paragraph. the next bullet must always start on a new line.
        - Maintain numbering or - consistently.
        - Keep each bullet concise and self-contained.
        - Focus on work order identification, project grouping, location patterns, and cross-reference insights
        - Highlight the search criteria used (heat number, NDE report, weld serial, or project number)

CRITICAL: The table output MUST follow the field detection rules unless it satisfies the error handling rules. This API provides basic work order lookup functionality, so always display all core fields.

For any counting questions, the total is {actual_count} work order records. Focus on providing comprehensive business analysis with emphasis on work order identification and cross-referencing.
